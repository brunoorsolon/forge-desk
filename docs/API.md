# HTTP API

The Forge Desk server (`forge-desk serve`, or `npm start`) exposes a small API next to the web UI. Planning reads tracker state; opt-in release publication can create approved tags and releases. All paths are at the root (there is no base-path option). The examples assume a local server on port 8080 started with the demo config:

```sh
FD_CONFIG=config.demo.yaml npm start
```

### `GET /api/views`

Returns one summary per configured view:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "demo",
    "title": "Acme demo roadmap",
    "source": "demo",
    "kind": "fixture",
    "repos": ["acme/api", "acme/web"]
  }
]
```

`kind` is the provider kind of the view's source (`github`, `gitea` or `fixture`).

### `GET /api/settings`

Returns the settings the web UI reads at startup:

```json
{ "refreshMinutes": 5, "version": "2.0.1" }
```

`refreshMinutes` is `ui.refreshMinutes` (or `FD_REFRESH_MINUTES`): the UI calls `GET /api/views/:id/snapshot` for the view it shows at that interval, respecting the shared snapshot cache. Only an explicit click on Refresh uses `POST /api/views/:id/refresh`. `0` means no automatic refresh.

`version` is the running server's version. The theme menu shows it at the bottom.

### `GET /api/views/:id/snapshot`

| Parameter       | Where  | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`            | path   | The view id.                                                                                                                                     |
| `refresh`       | query  | `1` or `true` bypasses the cache and refetches (concurrent refreshes of a view share one fetch). Any other value is ignored.                     |
| `If-None-Match` | header | An earlier `ETag`. When it matches the current content hash, the server answers `304` with no body. (`*` and weak `W/"..."` forms are accepted.) |

Response headers: `ETag: "<contentHash>"`, `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`, `Cache-Control: no-store`. The `ETag` is the snapshot's [content hash](DETERMINISM.md#the-content-hash): it changes when the plan or layout changes, and **not** when only `fetchedAt` changes, so a refresh that finds nothing new still answers `304` to a client that sends the last `ETag`. A tracker-side edit changes a node's `updatedAt` and so the hash, even when the order does not change.

### `POST /api/views/:id/refresh`

Same response as the snapshot endpoint (always `200` with a body, `ETag` header), after forcing a tracker revalidation. Send no body. GitHub reads reuse stored responses only after the tracker confirms they are unchanged; this does not bypass the shared rate-limit cooldown.

### `GET /api/views/:id/export.:format`

| `:format` | Content-Type                       | `Content-Disposition`              | Content                                                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `json`    | `application/json; charset=utf-8`  | `inline; filename="<viewId>.json"` | The full snapshot, indented, ending in a newline                                 |
| `md`      | `text/markdown; charset=utf-8`     | `inline; filename="<viewId>.md"`   | Waves as tables (with a Priority column), unschedulable issues, cycles, warnings |
| `mmd`     | `text/plain; charset=utf-8`        | `inline; filename="<viewId>.mmd"`  | A Mermaid `flowchart LR`                                                         |
| `dot`     | `text/vnd.graphviz; charset=utf-8` | `inline; filename="<viewId>.dot"`  | A Graphviz `digraph`, one `rank=same` group per wave                             |

`?refresh=1` works here too. Exports have no `ETag`. Any other extension answers `404`. The CLI produces the same text: `forge-desk plan <viewId> -f md|json|mermaid|dot`.

### `POST /api/webhooks/github` and `POST /api/webhooks/gitea`

Receivers for the tracker's webhooks: a verified delivery drops the cached snapshot of every view whose repositories include the repository named in the payload, so the next request refetches. They exist only when a webhook secret is configured (`webhooks` in the config, or `FD_WEBHOOK_SECRET`); otherwise they answer `404` like any unknown path. Setup: [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#webhooks).

- **Authentication** is the signature, not basic auth: these two `POST` paths (and nothing else) are exempt from basic auth. The signature is the HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body, keyed with the secret, compared in constant time.
  - `/api/webhooks/github`: header `X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=<hex>`.
  - `/api/webhooks/gitea`: header `X-Gitea-Signature: <hex>` or `X-Forgejo-Signature: <hex>` (plain hex, no prefix), or `X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=<hex>` (Gitea and Forgejo send that one too). One valid signature is enough.
- **Body:** JSON only (`Content-Type: application/json`); other content types answer `415`. The limit is 1 MiB (`413` above it). Configure GitHub webhooks with content type `application/json`, not `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- **Events:** a `ping` (`X-GitHub-Event`, `X-Gitea-Event` or `X-Forgejo-Event` equal to `ping`) answers `200` `{"ok":true}` and invalidates nothing. Any other event reads `repository.full_name` (compared in lower case), invalidates the matching views and answers `202` `{"invalidated":["<viewId>", ...]}` with the ids sorted. An unknown repository, or a payload without `repository.full_name`, answers `202` `{"invalidated":[]}`. The event type is not otherwise inspected, so subscribe only to the issue events you need.

| Status | When                                           | Body                            |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `200`  | Verified `ping`                                | `{"ok":true}`                   |
| `202`  | Verified delivery                              | `{"invalidated":["demo"]}`      |
| `400`  | Verified delivery whose body is not valid JSON | `{"error":"Invalid JSON body"}` |
| `401`  | Signature missing, malformed or wrong          | `{"error":"Invalid signature"}` |
| `404`  | No webhook secret is configured                | `{"error":"Not found"}`         |
| `413`  | Body larger than 1 MiB                         | `{"error":"<message>"}`         |
| `415`  | Content type other than `application/json`     | `{"error":"<message>"}`         |

```sh
BODY='{"action":"opened","repository":{"full_name":"acme/api"}}'
SIG=$(printf '%s' "$BODY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$FD_WEBHOOK_SECRET" | sed 's/^.* //')
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/webhooks/github \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=$SIG" \
  --data "$BODY"
```

Each accepted delivery is logged at info level (event, repository, invalidated views); the secret and the signature are never logged.

### Static UI

Everything else is served from the built web UI directory (`dist/web`). A `GET` for an unknown path that does not start with `/api/` and that accepts `text/html` falls back to `index.html` (single-page app); other unknown paths answer `404` `{"error":"Not found"}`. If the web UI has not been built, `/` shows a short "The web UI is not built" page and the API still works.

## Common behaviour

| Status | When                                                                                                              | Body                                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200`  | Success                                                                                                           | See above                                                   |
| `304`  | `If-None-Match` matches the snapshot's `ETag`                                                                     | none (headers `ETag`, `Cache-Control`)                      |
| `401`  | The login is enabled and there is no valid session cookie or basic-auth header                                    | `{"error":"Unauthorized"}`                                  |
| `404`  | Unknown view id, unknown export format, or unknown path                                                           | `{"error":"Unknown view: nope"}` or `{"error":"Not found"}` |
| `502`  | The tracker could not be reached or answered with an error (bad token, rate limit, network, repository not found) | `{"error":"<message>"}`, with tokens redacted               |
| `500`  | Unexpected internal error                                                                                         | `{"error":"Internal Server Error"}`                         |

- Every response under `/api/` carries `Cache-Control: no-store`. Caching is done by the server (see `cache.ttlSeconds`) and by `ETag`.
- Successful fetches are cached in memory per view for `cache.ttlSeconds` (default 300). The snapshot's `fetchedAt` tells you when the data was read. A failed fetch is not cached.
- Concurrent requests for the same view share one fetch.
- Planning requests to the tracker are `GET`s. Only explicitly approved release publication can create remote tags and releases; webhook receivers only invalidate cached planning data.
- The cache can also be dropped by [webhooks](#post-apiwebhooksgithub-and-post-apiwebhooksgitea); the TTL remains as a safety net.

## Authentication

When `server.basicAuth` (or `FD_BASIC_AUTH`) is configured, **every** path except `/healthz`, `/login` and `/logout` requires a session cookie from the login page or an HTTP basic-auth header with the same credentials, including the web UI and the exports. The only other exception is the pair of `POST /api/webhooks/*` endpoints (when enabled), which require a valid signature instead. Use it over TLS (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#login)).

Scripts send basic auth preemptively; there is no `WWW-Authenticate` challenge, because it would make browsers show their own dialog instead of the login page:

```sh
curl -u admin:change-me http://localhost:8080/api/views
```

Without credentials, a browser page load (`GET` with `Accept: text/html`) is redirected to the login page, and everything else gets:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
cache-control: no-store

{"error":"Unauthorized"}
```

### Release routes

When `releases.enabled` is true, the release routes exist and require the application login plus the release-specific proof below; when releases are disabled they are not registered at all (404). Release responses are `Cache-Control: no-store` and never contain a release token, SSH key, Authorization header, credential-bearing URL or private filesystem path.

Two caller kinds are accepted:

- **Browser.** A live session cookie, a `Host` header equal to `releases.publicOrigin`, and an `Origin` header equal to that origin when one is sent. A request that changes state (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) must send that `Origin` and the session-bound `x-csrf-token` value returned by `GET /api/session`. Forwarded headers (`X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, ...) never decide access.
- **CLI.** An explicit `Authorization` header with the same basic-auth credentials and no session cookie. A request that sends both is rejected, and an `Origin` it does supply must still match the configured origin.

Foreign origins, a missing or invalid credential or CSRF proof, and the webhook signature exemptions never grant release access.

`GET /api/releases/repositories` reports one entry per configured release repository: its allowlist `id`, `repo`, `source`, `forge`, `capability` (`available` or `blocked`) and sanitized `blockers` (`{ code, message }`). A forge outage or unsupported server blocks that repository's capability without stopping Planning or `/healthz`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "app",
    "repo": "example/app",
    "source": "gt",
    "forge": "https://gitea.example.com/",
    "capability": "blocked",
    "blockers": [{ "code": "network-error", "message": "GET /api/v1/user failed: fetch failed" }]
  }
]
```

### Publication, reconciliation and receipts

`POST /api/releases/plans/:planId/publish` accepts only JSON `{ "digest": "<64 lowercase hex characters>" }`, with a 1 KiB body limit and a bounded stored plan ID. The server derives the approver from the authenticated application login, persists approval intent, and starts publication independently of the connection. The `202` body contains the durable job fields and `statusUrl`; it means accepted, not published. Duplicate or lost-response retries return the same job without restarting execution, even after expiry. Poll `GET /api/releases/jobs/:jobId` for runtime blockers and the final outcome.

`POST /api/releases/jobs/:jobId/reconcile` accepts no body. It inspects the original publication and returns a reconciliation job, sharing concurrent requests for that publication. It never repeats a tag push or release create. A missing effect requires a fresh recovery plan and approval, not a repeated publication request.

`GET /api/releases/jobs/:jobId/receipt` returns `text/plain; charset=utf-8` for a publication job, joining its immutable plan and latest durable receipt. Missing or failed finalization remains visible as unavailable evidence or an artifact failure, never successful publication. Preparation jobs have no publication receipt.

These routes use stable `{ "code": "...", "error": "..." }` errors: invalid input or excessive body size (`400`), missing login (`401`), rejected origin or CSRF proof (`403`), unknown resources (`404`), stale/ineligible plans or unresolved attempts (`409`), expired new approval (`410`), and unavailable execution (`503`). Runtime failures after durable acceptance belong to the job. IDs are at most 128 ASCII letters, digits, dots, underscores or hyphens and begin with a letter or digit; the router can reject overlong paths before admission. Every response is `Cache-Control: no-store`.

## Snapshot schema

A snapshot is the JSON document returned by the snapshot, refresh and `export.json` endpoints. The authoritative TypeScript definitions are in [`src/core/types.ts`](../src/core/types.ts) (`Snapshot`, `Plan`, `PlanNode`, `Layout`, ...).

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `fetchedAt`      | ISO timestamp of the fetch. **Not** part of the hash                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `contentHash`    | SHA-256 hex of the canonical JSON of `{ plan, layout }`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `priorityLabels` | The view's configured `ordering.priorityLabels`, in rank order (index 0 is the most urgent). `plan.nodes[].priority` indexes into it, and `priority === priorityLabels.length` means the issue has no priority label. **Not** part of the hash: changing the configured labels already changes the hash through the `priority` values |
| `orderingMode`   | `priority` or `waves`: the view's `ordering.mode`. In `priority` mode `plan.order` can interleave waves; in `waves` mode it runs wave by wave. **Not** part of the hash on its own: `plan.order` already reflects it, so changing the mode changes the hash whenever it changes the order                                             |
| `plan`           | The dependency plan (below)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

A node has: `key` (`owner/repo#number`, lowercase), `repo`, `number`, `title`, `url`, `labels`, `assignees`, `milestone` (or `null`), `updatedAt` (the issue's last-update timestamp, or `null` when the provider does not report one), `external` (boolean), `status` (`ready`, `blocked`, `in-cycle` or `blocked-by-cycle`), `wave` and `order` (0-based, `null` when unschedulable), `blockedBy` and `blocks` (keys of open direct prerequisites and dependents), `parents` and `children` (keys of the `Parent:` hierarchy; never dependencies), `priority` (index in `priorityLabels`, or `priorityLabels.length`) and `remainingDepth`.

### `layout`

`width` and `height` of the drawing; `nodes` (`key`, `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `layer`, `row`) and `edges` (`from`, `to`, `points`: two `{x, y}` anchors, source right-middle to target left-middle). All numbers are integers. How they are computed: [DETERMINISM.md](DETERMINISM.md#layout).

Abridged real output (a five-issue view):

## Examples

Health check:

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

List the views:

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/views
```

Get the snapshot and read a few fields (requires `jq`):

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/views/demo/snapshot | jq '{hash: .contentHash, stats: .plan.stats, order: .plan.order[:3]}'
```

Show the response headers (`ETag`, `Cache-Control`):

```sh
curl -sI http://localhost:8080/api/views/demo/snapshot
```

Conditional request: only download when the plan changed. When the `ETag` still matches, the server answers `304` with no body (use the `ETag` of your own last response):

```sh
curl -s -o /dev/null -D - -H 'If-None-Match: "1f532dbcf53112168cfe1903885c9b0bb3836b2ec6e75ae955ddaee5ecc6fae3"' http://localhost:8080/api/views/demo/snapshot
```

etag: "1f532dbcf53112168cfe1903885c9b0bb3836b2ec6e75ae955ddaee5ecc6fae3"
cache-control: no-store
```

Force a refetch from the tracker:

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/views/demo/refresh -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n'
```

```sh
curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/api/views/demo/snapshot?refresh=1' | jq -r .fetchedAt
```

Download exports:

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/views/demo/export.md -o demo.md
```

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/views/demo/export.mmd -o demo.mmd
```

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/views/demo/export.dot | dot -Tsvg -o demo.svg
```

(`dot` is Graphviz.) Unknown view:

```sh
curl -si http://localhost:8080/api/views/nope/snapshot
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
