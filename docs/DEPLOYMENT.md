# Deployment

Forge Desk is a single Node.js process: no database, and planning snapshots stay in memory. Optional account preferences persist favorites and the remembered project to a local directory. It listens on one port and serves the web UI and the API. Pick one of the setups below. Release publication is opt-in and adds a private state volume, a login and dedicated credentials; its deployment, permissions, backup and cutover guide is [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md). Images are published to `ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk`; the old `ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/execution-view` path stops at 2.0.5 (see [the name](../README.md#the-name)).

## Before you deploy

1. Read [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md): how dependencies must be declared, and which token you need.
2. Decide between a config file ([CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md)) and env-only mode (one source, one view, from environment variables).
3. Create a **read-only** token and keep it in an environment variable or a secret, not in the config file.
4. Run `forge-desk check` against your real repositories before exposing the service.

## Docker

Every release publishes a multi-arch image (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) to the GitHub Container Registry:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk:3
```

Tags: the exact version (`3.0.1`), the minor (`3.0`), the major (`3`, used in these examples: it follows the newest 3.x release) and `latest`. Pin an exact version if you want to upgrade by hand.

To build the image yourself instead (for example to test unreleased changes), run this from the repository root and use `forge-desk` as the image name in the commands below:

```sh
docker build -t forge-desk .
```

The image is a multi-stage build on `node:22-alpine`: it compiles the server and the web UI, then keeps only production dependencies and the compiled output. Its final stage also contains real `git`, OpenSSH `ssh` and util-linux `flock`, so the same image can publish releases; planning-only browsing does not use git/ssh; preferences also use flock. It runs as the non-root user `node`, exposes port 8080, has `FD_HOST=0.0.0.0` and `FD_PORT=8080` set, and its entrypoint is the CLI with the default command `serve`. So `docker run ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk:3 check` runs the check instead of the server.

### The demo (no token, no network)

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -e FD_CONFIG=/app/config.demo.yaml ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk:3
```

`config.demo.yaml`, `config.example.yaml` and the demo fixture are part of the image.

### Env-only (no config file)

```sh
docker run -d --name forge-desk -p 8080:8080 --restart unless-stopped -e FD_PROVIDER=github -e FD_REPOS=owner/repo -e GITHUB_TOKEN ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk:3
```

For Gitea add `-e FD_BASE_URL=https://gitea.example.com` and use `-e GITEA_TOKEN`. All variables are listed in [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#env-only-mode). Put the variables in a file to keep them out of your shell history and process list:

```sh
docker run -d --name forge-desk -p 8080:8080 --restart unless-stopped --env-file .env ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk:3
```

### With a config file

The image does **not** set `FD_CONFIG`. Without it, the default lookup is `<cwd>/config.yaml`, which is `/app/config.yaml` in the image: mount your file there.

```sh
docker run -d --name forge-desk -p 8080:8080 --restart unless-stopped -v "$PWD/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro" --env-file .env ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk:3
```

Notes:

- The container runs as user `node` (uid 1000 in the official Node image): the mounted file must be readable by that user.
- Make sure the file exists on the host before you start the container. If a bind-mount source does not exist, Docker creates a **directory** with that name, and the app then does not see a config file.
- In the config, refer to tokens with `tokenEnv: GITHUB_TOKEN` and pass the variable with `-e GITHUB_TOKEN` or `--env-file`.
- Fixture paths in a mounted config are relative to `/app` (the directory of the config file).

### Verify inside the container

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro" --env-file .env ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk:3 check
```

The exit code is `0`, `1` or `2` (see [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md#verify-with-forge-desk-check)).

The repository also has `scripts/smoke-test.sh`, which builds the image and tests the demo and env-only modes (it is what CI runs).

## docker-compose

The step-by-step setup is in the README: [Run it on your repo with docker compose](../README.md#run-it-on-your-repo-with-docker-compose). In short, put `docker-compose.yml` (from the repository) in a folder, set your repositories in its `environment:` block, put the token in a `.env` next to it (from `.env.example`), then:

```sh
docker compose run --rm forge-desk check
```

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

What the compose file does:

- runs `ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk` pinned to an exact version, as `container_name: forge-desk`, publishes `8080:8080` and restarts `unless-stopped`;
- sets the env-only settings (`FD_PROVIDER`, `FD_REPOS`, and `FD_BASE_URL` for Gitea) in `environment:`, and passes the token as `GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}` (or `GITEA_TOKEN`). Docker Compose fills in `${...}` from `.env` in the same folder; nothing else from `.env` reaches the container. With a config file, keep only the token lines: `tokenEnv: GITHUB_TOKEN` in the config finds them;
- has a commented-out `volumes:` entry that mounts `./config.yaml` at `/app/config.yaml` for config-file mode. Create the file before you uncomment it, otherwise Docker creates a directory with that name;
- carries `wud.tag.include` / `wud.tag.exclude` labels so [What's Up Docker](https://getwud.github.io/wud/) reports new releases (exact `X.Y.Z` tags only). They do nothing without it.

No data volume is needed for planning snapshots: they are cached in memory (`FD_CACHE_TTL`) and fetched again after a restart. Enabling [personal preferences](#personal-preferences) additionally needs a writable local directory and the application login. Release publication is different: it requires the private state volume, login and dedicated credentials described in [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md), and [`docker-compose.release.yml`](../docker-compose.release.yml) is the ready-made compose file for that mode.

To build from source instead of pulling, replace the `image:` line with `build: .` and run `docker compose up -d --build` from the repository root. To publish only on localhost (when a reverse proxy runs on the same host), change the port mapping to `'127.0.0.1:8080:8080'`.

## Personal preferences

Preferences are opt-in and store favorites and the remembered project for the **single application account**, shared by its browser sessions. They are not separate profiles per browser or person. They require both the application's login and `preferences.dir` (or `FD_PREFERENCES_DIR`); proxy authentication alone does not enable them. Without these, planning remains available and preferences report unavailable.

Use a persistent directory on a trusted **local Linux filesystem**. The runtime requires util-linux `flock` (included in the repository's Docker image); NFS, SMB/CIFS and unknown filesystem types are refused. The directory must already exist, be owned by the runtime user and not be group- or world-writable. Use mode `0700`. Do not use a symlink for the directory or preference file. The app does not create the directory for you.

Merge this into your existing config (keep your sources and views):

```yaml
server:
  basicAuth:
    username: admin
    passwordEnv: FD_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD
  publicOrigin: https://desk.example.com
preferences:
  dir: /var/lib/forge-desk-preferences
```

For Docker, prepare a host directory owned by the container's uid/gid 1000 (run with sufficient host privileges, and adapt ownership for rootless/user-remapped Docker):

```sh
install -d -m 0700 -o 1000 -g 1000 preferences
```

Mount the **directory**, not just `preferences.json`: writes need temporary files and an atomic rename in the same directory. Add this to your usual `docker run` command:

```sh
--mount "type=bind,src=$PWD/preferences,dst=/var/lib/forge-desk-preferences"
```

For Compose, add the following under the existing `forge-desk` service, merging rather than duplicating its `environment` and `volumes` keys. Keep the token environment lines, remove env-only source settings if switching to a config file, and set `FD_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` in `.env`:

```yaml
services:
  forge-desk:
    environment:
      - GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
      - FD_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=${FD_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD:?Set the application login password}
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro
      - ./preferences:/var/lib/forge-desk-preferences
```

The preference volume must be writable; the config stays read-only. Use an image version containing preference support, or build this checkout. The stock Compose example does not mount preference storage. A named volume is also possible, but initialize its ownership and permissions before enabling preferences; do not assume Docker's newly created root-owned directory is usable. Keep preference and release state in separate directories. For bare Node, install util-linux and prepare the directory for the service account. With the hardened systemd unit below, add `ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/forge-desk-preferences` under `[Service]` after preparing that directory.

### Ownership and failure recovery

Only **one process may own a preference directory**. Its supervised OS lock is held for the process lifetime in `preferences.lock`; a second process reports preferences unavailable (`store-locked`), without overwriting the file or preventing planning. Stop the old owner before starting a replacement during upgrades. This is not a replicated or multi-writer store.

Never delete, replace or rotate `preferences.lock` while any owner may be running: changing the inode can defeat mutual exclusion. A leftover lock file after shutdown is normal, not proof of a stuck owner. The OS releases ownership when the holder exits. Graceful shutdown drains admitted writes before releasing the lock. If ownership is lost, writes fail closed; repair the cause and restart the server.

A missing `preferences.json` starts with an empty profile and is created on the first effective change, with mode `0600`. Invalid JSON or shape (`corrupt`), an unsupported schema version, missing storage, or unsafe/unreadable storage disables preferences without silently resetting them. Stop the server, preserve the original bytes, repair permissions or restore a known-good compatible backup, then restart. Do not change a version field to force an incompatible file to load. Preference state is read once at startup, so editing a file while running is neither a supported restore nor a reset. `/healthz` only checks process liveness; inspect the preferences response/UI to verify recovery.

### Backup, restore and reset

1. Stop the writer (`docker compose stop forge-desk`, or stop the corresponding container/systemd service) and verify no other process is using this directory. Keep it stopped throughout backup, restore or reset.
2. Back up `preferences.json` if present to a private location, preserving its bytes and recording the application version. Protect backups as private account data. Keep any `.preferences-*.backup` recovery files when diagnosing a failed write; do not overwrite or discard them before identifying the known-good state. The lock file is not preference data and does not need restoring.
3. To restore, put the compatible backed-up `preferences.json` into the prepared directory as a regular file, owned by the runtime user, mode `0600`. Keep the directory owned by that user, mode `0700`. Do not restore a lock from another machine or replace a live lock.
4. To deliberately **reset all favorites and the remembered project**, back up first, then delete only `preferences.json` **with the server stopped**. Leave the directory and `preferences.lock` in place. On restart the profile is empty; this does not delete tracker data, release state or configuration.
5. Start one server and verify preferences are available and contain the expected profile. Keep the volume mounted across image/container replacements.

## Background sweeps and API quota

Sweeps refresh the complete configured project catalog across sources, not only favorites or the current named view. They are disabled by default (`refresh.sweepHours: 0`, or `FD_SWEEP_HOURS=0`); manual sweeps remain possible. To opt in:

```yaml
refresh:
  sweepHours: 6
  requestsPerMinute: 60
  concurrency: 4
```

The interval is an integer from 0 to 168 hours. When enabled, a sweep starts at server startup and the next starts a full interval **after completion**. Repeated manual/scheduled launches join an existing sweep rather than overlap; a manual sweep also resets the next deadline from its finish. With `cache.ttlSeconds: 0`, sweeps are skipped and no recurring sweep timer is armed. Sweeps do not need preference storage or the login.

The default admission limits are 60 requests per minute and 4 concurrent requests **per source**. They pace individual provider HTTP requests, including pagination, relation reads and retries, rather than counting repositories. Interactive project work has priority over sweep work, and provider cooldowns delay the affected source while healthy sources continue. Status exposes queued/delayed/failed work and successful check times; a finished sweep may report partial or failed results rather than a fully refreshed catalog.

Budget quota for startup sweeps after every restart and for the entire catalog. These limits are not a global token quota: sources/processes may share tracker credentials, and named-view reads, exports and CLI operations do not use this admission pacing. Leave headroom for those and other tools using the same account. Increase the sweep interval or lower pacing when quota is tight; webhooks and cache TTL remain useful independently. Observations and sweep status are in memory and are not part of preference backups.

## Release publication

Release publication is opt-in and runs in the same non-root image. It needs an image release that ships the release runtime (real `git`, `ssh` and `flock`), the four mounts and the private local state volume built by [`docker-compose.release.yml`](../docker-compose.release.yml), the application login, and dedicated release credentials for Gitea 1.26.1. The complete operational guide is [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md): volume ownership, token scopes and account permissions, SSH host trust, the one-writer limit, shutdown and restart recovery, backup and restore, state-schema compatibility, the absence of remote rollback, MIT attribution and the legacy cutover from the terminal publisher.

```sh
install -d -m 0700 -o 1000 -g 1000 release-state
# FD_IMAGE must name a Forge Desk image release that ships the release runtime; the Compose file
# refuses to start without it. Replace `image:` with `build: .` instead to build this repository.
printf 'FD_IMAGE=ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk:%s\n' '<release>' >> .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml run --rm forge-desk check
docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml up -d
```

Planning deployments without releases do not need release credentials or release state. Preferences separately require their own directory and the application login; otherwise the env-only or config-file setup can remain volume-free and login-free.

## Bare Node.js

Requires **Node.js 22 or newer**.

```sh
npm ci
```

```sh
npm run build
```

`npm run build` compiles the server to `dist/` and the web UI to `dist/web/`. Then start it, with the config chosen by `FD_CONFIG` (or `./config.yaml`, or env-only variables):

```sh
npm start
```

`npm start` runs `node dist/server/index.js`, which reads no command-line flags. To pass a config path as a flag, use the CLI:

```sh
node dist/cli/index.js serve --config /etc/forge-desk/config.yaml
```

Both handle `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` with a graceful shutdown, and log JSON lines (one per request and event) to standard output. The server must be started from a checkout where `dist/web` is next to `dist/server`, otherwise it serves the API only (with a "web UI is not built" page at `/`). `npm run dev` (which watches `src/`) does not build the web UI.

## systemd

An example unit for a bare-Node install in `/opt/forge-desk` (build it there with `npm ci && npm run build`). This is an example: adapt users, paths and the Node.js path to your system.

`/etc/systemd/system/forge-desk.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=forge-desk
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=forge-desk
Group=forge-desk
WorkingDirectory=/opt/forge-desk
EnvironmentFile=/etc/forge-desk/env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node dist/cli/index.js serve --config /etc/forge-desk/config.yaml
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
NoNewPrivileges=true
PrivateTmp=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

`/etc/forge-desk/env` (readable only by root, mode `0600`; the file is read by systemd, which then hands the variables to the service):

```sh
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
FD_HOST=127.0.0.1
FD_BASIC_AUTH=admin:change-me
```

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now forge-desk
```

```sh
journalctl -u forge-desk -f
```

## Reverse proxy

The app serves everything at the **root path** (`/`, `/api/...`, `/healthz`) and has **no base-path option**, so it cannot live under a sub-path such as `https://example.com/ev/`. Give it a host name of its own. (The web UI itself uses relative URLs, so a proxy that strips a path prefix, with the UI opened at `/ev/` including the trailing slash, may work; this is untested and not supported.)

nginx:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name ev.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/ev.example.com.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/ev.example.com.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 120s;
    }
}
```

Caddy (obtains and renews the certificate automatically):

```caddy
ev.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}
```

For preference mutations and project/sweep refresh launches behind a proxy that rewrites `Host`, set `server.publicOrigin: https://ev.example.com` (or `FD_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`) to the browser-facing origin, including any non-default port. Use HTTPS, no path, query, fragment or credentials; plain HTTP is allowed only for isolated loopback tests. The configured origin supplies the trusted host and port; without it the app compares the browser's `Origin` to the request `Host`. Forwarded host headers do not establish trust. Preserve `Origin`, cookies and the UI's CSRF/launch headers. This setting does not enable login or preferences. Release publication has its own `releases.publicOrigin` and stricter request checks; follow [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md).

Notes:

- A cold refresh of a large view makes many requests to the tracker and can take a while: allow a generous read timeout (the nginx example uses 120 s).
- Static files are resolved on every request, so after `npm run build` (or replacing `dist/web`) the new UI is served without restarting the app; a `dist/web` created after startup is picked up too. `index.html` is sent with `Cache-Control: no-cache` (also for the deep-link fallback), files under `assets/` (hashed names) with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`, other static files with `no-cache`, and `/api/*` with `no-store`. A proxy that caches should keep honouring these headers.
- Bind the app to loopback (`FD_HOST=127.0.0.1`, or publish `127.0.0.1:8080:8080` from Docker) so that only the proxy can reach it.
- The proxy is a good place for authentication and TLS; see the next section.

## Login

The app has an optional login that protects **everything except `/healthz`** (web UI, API and exports). Enable it in the config:

```yaml
server:
  basicAuth:
    username: admin
    passwordEnv: FD_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD
```

or with the environment variable `FD_BASIC_AUTH=user:password`, which overrides the config block. Prefer `passwordEnv` (or an env file) over an inline `password`.

In a browser, the app shows a login page that password managers can fill. Logging in sets an HttpOnly session cookie that lasts 30 days, and **Log out** is in the theme menu. Sessions live in memory, so a restart (an upgrade, for example) means logging in again. Scripts send HTTP basic auth with the same credentials instead; they must send it **preemptively** (`curl -u` does), because the app does not answer with a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge.

The password crosses the network in clear text on the login form and with basic auth, and the session cookie works like a password while it lasts. Only use the login over **HTTPS**, i.e. behind a reverse proxy with TLS; the cookie is marked `Secure` when the request came over HTTPS, directly or with `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. There is no limit on failed login attempts, so use a long password. For anything beyond a small team, prefer your proxy's own authentication (SSO, VPN, IP allow-list) in front of the app, with or without the app's login. Password comparison is done in constant time.

## Webhooks

By default a view is refetched when its cache entry expires (`cache.ttlSeconds`, 300 s) or when someone presses Refresh. With webhooks, GitHub, Gitea or Forgejo tells the app when an issue or pull request changes, and the app drops the cached snapshot of the views that include that repository; the next page load or API call refetches. Webhook invalidation alone does not refetch; an enabled background sweep can also perform the later refresh.

The UI labels below may vary between versions of GitHub, Gitea and Forgejo.

**1. Choose a secret** and give it to the app. Use a long random string, for example `openssl rand -hex 32`:

```sh
FD_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<the secret>
```

or, in the config file, `webhooks.secretEnv: FD_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (the name of an environment variable; recommended) or an inline `webhooks.secret` (see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#webhooks)). Without a secret, the webhook endpoints do not exist.

**2. Add a webhook to each repository** of your views, pointing at your public URL (the tracker must be able to reach it; see the reverse proxy notes below):

| Tracker          | Payload URL                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub           | `https://ev.example.com/api/webhooks/github` |
| Gitea or Forgejo | `https://ev.example.com/api/webhooks/gitea`  |

GitHub: repository **Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**. Set the payload URL, content type `application/json`, and the secret. Under events choose **Let me select individual events** and tick **Issues** and **Pull requests**, plus **Issue dependencies** and **Sub-issues** when they are offered (they carry dependency and sub-issue changes). Keep the webhook **Active**. GitHub sends a `ping` when you save it; it should show a green tick (`200`).

Gitea or Forgejo: repository **Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**, then choose **Gitea** (on Forgejo: **Forgejo**). Set the target URL, HTTP method `POST`, content type `application/json`, and the secret. Trigger on both issue and pull-request events (for example **Custom events** with the issue and pull-request events selected). Include opening, editing, closing and reopening for both, as well as the other issue events offered (labeled, assigned, milestoned, and so on; a dependency change is an issue edit on the tracker side). Gitea and Forgejo sign deliveries with `X-Gitea-Signature` / `X-Forgejo-Signature` (and `X-Hub-Signature-256`); any of them is accepted. The **Test delivery** button (if your version has one) sends a sample event; any correctly signed delivery is accepted, and it invalidates the views of the repository unless it is a `ping`.

Pull-request events keep **In progress** current when a closing PR opens, its closing references are edited, or it closes or reopens. Select these events even if you already receive issue events.

Only JSON is accepted. Organization-level or system-level webhooks also work if they send repository events, since only `repository.full_name` is read.

**3. Check it:** in the tracker's webhook page, look at the recent deliveries (`202` with an `invalidated` list of view ids is the expected answer for an issue or pull-request event; `401` means the secret does not match; `404` means the app has no secret configured). The app logs each accepted delivery at info level (event, repository, invalidated views), and never logs the secret or the signature.

Reverse proxy notes:

- The proxy must forward the request **body unchanged** (no re-encoding, compression or rewriting). The signature is computed over the exact bytes the tracker sent, so any change makes the delivery fail with `401`. Forward the `X-Hub-Signature-256`, `X-Gitea-Signature`, `X-Forgejo-Signature` and `X-GitHub-Event`/`X-Gitea-Event`/`X-Forgejo-Event` headers (proxies do this by default).
- Webhook requests are **not** subject to the app's login (the signature is their authentication), so the tracker does not need credentials. If your proxy adds its own authentication in front of the app, let `/api/webhooks/*` through it.
- The body limit is 1 MiB (`413` above it); keep any proxy limit at least that large (nginx: `client_max_body_size`, default 1 MB).
- The tracker must reach the app over the network: for a self-hosted app on a private network this means a tracker on the same network, or a publicly reachable URL restricted to the tracker's IP addresses.

The cache TTL still applies as a safety net: a missed or failed delivery only delays an update until the TTL expires (or Refresh is pressed). You can raise `cache.ttlSeconds` once webhooks work reliably, to reduce tracker API usage.

## Health check

`GET /healthz` returns `200` and `{"status":"ok"}`, with no authentication. It only says that the process is up and serving; it does **not** call your tracker. Use `forge-desk check` to verify tokens and repositories.

The Docker image already declares a `HEALTHCHECK` (every 30 s, 5 s timeout, 10 s start period, 3 retries) that requests `/healthz` on `FD_PORT`. `docker ps` shows `healthy` when it works.

```sh
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

## Resource needs

Small for planning. There is no database, and planning snapshots are not persistent: the process keeps one snapshot per view in memory, and the cost of a refresh is a burst of HTTP requests to your tracker (see [API usage](PREREQUISITES.md#8-api-usage-and-rate-limits)) plus a graph computation that is fast for hundreds or thousands of issues. A small container or VM is enough (for example 256 MB of memory and a fraction of a CPU). Optional preferences add a small private JSON store. Release publication adds one private state volume, the Git/SSH binaries and a short-lived candidate checkout; it does not change the memory profile materially. These are rough sizing hints; the project has no published benchmarks.

## Security notes

- **Use read-only tokens** with the minimum scope ([PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md#7-tokens-and-permissions)) for planning. The planning app only sends `GET` requests, but a token can do whatever its scopes allow.
- **Release publication needs write access, and only there.** Enabling `releases` mounts a dedicated `write:repository` token and an SSH key that can push the approved tag; the planning token must stay separate. Keep both read-only mounts, the login and the private state volume as described in [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md). Publication only ever creates the explicitly approved tag and release; it cannot force-push, delete or upload assets.
- **The token is never logged.** Error messages that could contain it are redacted, and the request log records the method, path and host but not headers. The HTTP client refuses to send the token to any host other than the configured `baseUrl`. API error responses redact the token too.
- Keep tokens out of the image, the repository and the config file: use `tokenEnv`, `--env-file`, Docker or systemd secrets. `.env` and `config.yaml` are git-ignored, and `.env` is excluded from the Docker build context.
- **What the app exposes:** issue titles, labels, assignees, milestones and URLs of the configured repositories (bodies are not exposed). Anyone who can reach the service can read those, including titles from **private** repositories your token can see. Use the login and/or the proxy's authentication, and TLS.
- The process runs as a non-root user in the Docker image and listens on all interfaces by default (`0.0.0.0`): restrict `FD_HOST` or the published port when you do not want that.
- The login over plain HTTP is not confidential (see above).
- **Webhooks** are authenticated only by the HMAC signature (constant-time comparison); use a long random secret and keep it like a token. Anyone who has it can make the app drop its caches (the worst effect is extra tracker requests), nothing more.
- `FD_BASIC_AUTH` and `-e TOKEN=value` are visible to anyone who can run `docker inspect` or read the process environment; prefer files and secrets on shared hosts.

## Upgrading

Planning snapshots are in memory, so upgrading without preferences or releases means replacing the code and restarting. With preferences enabled, stop the writer, back up the profile, retain its volume and start one replacement process as described [above](#backup-restore-and-reset). With releases enabled, keep the private state volume: stop the owner, replace the image and start it again, then let startup reconcile interrupted jobs ([RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md#upgrading-state-schema-and-rollback)).

Docker with compose:

```sh
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Plain Docker: `docker pull ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk:3`, remove the old container (`docker rm -f forge-desk`) and run your usual `docker run` command again. With a pinned version, change the tag first. Release notes are on the [releases page](https://github.com/brunoorsolon/forge-desk/releases).

From source: `git pull`, then `docker build -t forge-desk .` (or `docker compose up -d --build` with `build: .`).

Bare Node.js: `git pull && npm ci && npm run build`, then restart the service (`sudo systemctl restart forge-desk`).

Upgrading from 2.x to 3.0.0: the image moved, so change `ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/execution-view` to `ghcr.io/brunoorsolon/forge-desk` in your compose file or `docker run` command; the old path gets no tags after 2.0.5. Your config, `.env` and `EV_*` variables stay as they are. The current compose files name the service and container `forge-desk`; if you switch to them, remove the old container once with `docker rm -f execution-view` before `docker compose up -d`, because it still holds the port. With plain Docker, do the same and use `--name forge-desk`. The `execution-view` command is gone: scripts and systemd units must call `forge-desk` (an existing unit can keep its own name and paths). Anything that matches the old tracker `User-Agent` (`execution-view`), the DOT graph id (`digraph "execution-view"`) or the `execution-view listening on` log line must match `forge-desk` instead. The web UI no longer reads the theme and line mode that 2.x saved, so pick them again once. If you copied `skills/execution-view-issues/` for your agents, replace it with [`skills/forge-desk-issues/`](../skills/forge-desk-issues/SKILL.md).

Upgrading to 3.0.1: the environment variables are renamed from `EV_` to `FD_` (`EV_BASIC_AUTH` becomes `FD_BASIC_AUTH`, `EV_IMAGE` becomes `FD_IMAGE`, and so on). Nothing changes until you rename: every `EV_` name still works until the next major release, still wins over its `FD_` counterpart, and gets a startup warning. Rename each variable in `.env` and in your compose file's `environment:` lines in one step, because Compose passes the container only the names listed there; a `FD_BASIC_AUTH` that is set in `.env` but not listed under `environment:` never reaches the app, so it starts without its login. The release Compose file now requires `FD_IMAGE` and stops with a message while only `EV_IMAGE` is set. Then run `forge-desk check`: it prints a warning for every remaining `EV_` name.

After every upgrade, run `forge-desk check`. The configuration schema is strict, so a key that was removed or renamed makes the app refuse to start with a clear message; compare your `config.yaml` with `config.example.yaml`. Cached snapshots are in memory only and start empty after a restart.

## Building the image behind an HTTPS-intercepting proxy

The build runs `npm ci` inside the image, which downloads packages over HTTPS. If your network intercepts TLS with its own certificate authority (a corporate proxy), npm inside the build does not trust that CA and the build fails, typically with certificate errors (`SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`, `unable to get local issuer certificate`) or with an npm crash. The stock Dockerfile has no option for this. Hints (untested here, adapt to your environment):

- Build on a machine or network without interception, or build the image in CI and pull it.
- Or use a local copy of the Dockerfile that adds your proxy's root CA before each `npm ci`, for example:

```dockerfile
COPY corp-ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/corp-ca.crt
ENV NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/corp-ca.crt
```

placed after `FROM` in **both** stages (`build` and `runtime`), and `docker build` proxy settings (`--build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=...`) if the proxy itself must be configured.

- Do not disable TLS verification (`strict-ssl=false`) to work around it.

This only concerns building. At run time, the app itself talks to GitHub or Gitea directly; if that traffic is intercepted too, start the container with `-e NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/ca.pem` and mount the certificate file.
